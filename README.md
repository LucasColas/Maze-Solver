## More explanation
main.py is the entry point. The folder called src contains the code of the project.
If you click on generate, it will generate a maze. You can then click (with mouse left button) on two non black cells. The orange cell will be the starting point. The purple point will be the ending point. Click on solve to visualize the pathfinding. You can also clear path to visualize a different in the same maze.
You can also just click (with mouse left button) on two blank cells to have you starting and ending point. And then press your mouse left button and go over the cells to create black walls. Then hit solve to see the visualization of pathfinding.
